This project will compare drug data and labor data to see if there is a correlation. We will use CORGIS datasets. Users can choose a year from a 1992-2014 to generate two graphs. The labor data will be displayed in a pie chart to show the amount of employed people vs. unemployed in that year. A bar graph will show the percentage of people using each type of drug in the year you choose.
