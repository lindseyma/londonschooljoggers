This project will compare health data and labor data to see if there is a correlation. We will use CORGIS datasets. Users can choose a specific health problem from a drop down menu to generate an overlaid graph. The labor data will be displayed on the graph as a stacked bar graph out of 100 to portray the percentage of people employed vs. unemployed. A line graph will will show the percentage of people suffering from the health problem in each year.
